                <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
                <p>
                    Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way. <a href="solar-system.html">Read more</a>

                    <h3>Kuiper Belt</h3>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets. The Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space -- it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. <a href="kuiper.html">Read more</a>

                    <h3>Oort Cloud</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Oort Cloud is the most distant region of our solar system. Even the nearest objects in the Oort Cloud are thought to be many times farther from the Sun than the outer reaches of the Kuiper Belt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the orbits of the planets and the Kuiper Belt, which lie mostly in the same flat disk around the Sun, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the rest of the solar system. It is like a big, thick-walled bubble made of icy pieces of space debris the sizes of mountains and sometimes larger. The Oort Cloud might contain billions, or even trillions, of objects. <a href="">Read more</a>

                    <p>
                        Our Sun is one of at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy about 100,000 light-years across. The Latest Oceans, Beaches, Cosmic Shorelines: Our Changing Views of Habitable Planets The stars are arranged in a pinwheel pattern with four major arms, and we live in one of them, about two-thirds of the way outward from the center. Most of the stars in our galaxy are thought to host their own families of planets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Milky Way galaxy is just one of billion of galaxies in the universe. The universe is a vast expanse of space which contains all of everything in existence. The universe contains all of the galaxies, stars, and planets. The exact size of the universe is unknown. Scientists believe the universe is still expanding outward. <a href="">Read more</a>
