                <h2>What is the Solar System?</h2>
                <p>
                    The universe is a very large place and we only exist in a very small portion of it. The area that we occupy is known as the Solar System. The Solar System consists of 8 formations we identify as planets, satellites that orbit these planets, and an average-sized star we recognize as the Sun. We identify the four inner planets as "Terrestrial Planets" because they are composed primarily of silicate rocks and metals. The remaining four planets are referred to as "Jovian" planets or simply "gas giants."

                <h2>When did it form?</h2>
                <p>
                    The origin story of the solar system starts with a simple cloud of stellar dust approximately 4.6 billion years ago. This cloud of dust was part of what is known as a nebula. At some point, this cloud collapsed into itself and the hydrogen atoms within the nebula began to fuse into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of a disk of material. This process led to the birth of the Sun. The leftover 1% of material not consumed by the Sun was propelled outwards and gravity caused the material to fuse. Big objects collided with other big objects, forming larger objects that took the form of spheres. Those spheres are now known as planets and dwarf planets. The terrestrial planets formed near the Sun because the icy and gaseous planets cannot survive near all that heat. Gas and icy formations formed further away, creating the gas and ice giants. The current asteroids that are found in our solar system are the bits and pieces that never formed into planets. Comets are even further out and their composition hasn't changed since the formation of the solar system. It was the study of asteroids and comets that allowed scientists to discover this information.
